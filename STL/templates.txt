A template is a simple tool. 
The simple idea is to pass data types as a parameter so that we don't need to write the same code for different data types.
Two new keywords for templates are template and typename. 
the second keyword can always bee replaced by the keyword class. 

function templates, are generic functions that can be used for different data types.
